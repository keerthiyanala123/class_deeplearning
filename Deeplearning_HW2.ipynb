        "\n",
        "C. Yes, additional hyperparameters can be used to achieve accuracy levels higher than 80.0 percent. The accuracy of a model can be increased by tuning the hyperparameters with a methodical approach like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Adjustable hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons in each layer. \n",

        "D. More epochs of training a machine learning model does not always result in better performance, even when all other hyperparameters are held constant. In fact, overfitting, where the model becomes overly specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to new data, can occur as a result of training for an excessively long number of epochs.\n",
